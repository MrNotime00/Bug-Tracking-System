# Bug-Tracking-System

**Bug Tracking Adventure**

Hey there! Imagine a world where bugs are tiny creatures wreaking havoc in the digital kingdom. Fear not, for our Bug Tracking System is here to save the day!

First off, we've got our cool users, each with a secret key to unlock their digital realm. They bravely register with usernames and passwords, guarded by the mystical power of SHA-256.

Now, let's dive into the heart of our kingdom â€“ the Projects! These are like magical realms where our users embark on quests to conquer bugs. We've got "Project A" and "Project B," each with its own set of challenges.

Bug warriors, known as "Bugs," are born with unique descriptions, like "UI not responsive" and "Crash on startup." But beware, some bugs are so sneaky, they can resolve themselves!

Our Bug Tracking System's console is the enchanted mirror reflecting the status of each project. It vividly displays the ongoing bug battles, indicating which bugs have fallen under the resolution spell.

But wait, there's a twist! Heroes of the digital world, armed with their knowledge of the mystical incantations, can now resolve bugs. However, be cautious not to double-resolve a bug; even digital creatures need a rest!

So, there you have it â€“ the Bug Tracking Adventure, where users, bugs, and projects collide in a mystical dance of creation and resolution. Join the quest, and may your code be bug-free! ðŸš€âœ¨
